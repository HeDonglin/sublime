(#135)\n\nWith commit 8beb41e the `self.process.poll()` function was removed,\r\nwhich checks, whether the subprocess (language-server) was terminated.\r\n\r\nTherefore the `read_stdout()` and `read_stderr()` methonds of Client\r\nnever exit and run without any sleep time after the process exits.\r\n\r\nThis commit reintroduces `self.process.poll()` but makes sure the\r\nalready sent stdout/stderr content is still read and processed by LSP.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the output checks of `stderr.readline()` / `stdout.readline()`\r\nare simplified as using `len()` is not the best solution here. It will\r\nfail if the passed string is None.","tree":{"sha":"254e5542bec1151cc93e37a0192a1a090c41e35a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomv564/LSP/git/trees/254e5542bec1151cc93e37a0192a1a090c41e35a"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomv564/LSP/git/commits/20b0ce1638481c9f3c45296625af9f975a489d20","comment_count":0},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomv564/LSP/commits/20b0ce1638481c9f3c45296625af9f975a489d20","html_url":"https://github.com/tomv564/LSP/commit/20b0ce1638481c9f3c45296625af9f975a489d20","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomv564/LSP/commits/20b0ce1638481c9f3c45296625af9f975a489d20/comments","author":{"login":"deathaxe","id":16542113,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16542113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathaxe","html_url":"https://github.com/deathaxe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathaxe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathaxe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathaxe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathaxe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathaxe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathaxe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathaxe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathaxe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathaxe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"tomv564","id":4395832,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4395832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomv564","html_url":"https://github.com/tomv564","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomv564/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomv564/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomv564/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomv564/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomv564/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomv564/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomv564/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomv564/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomv564/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"9a546564806453f830ab6394f47e33d56e174181","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomv564/LSP/commits/9a546564806453f830ab6394f47e33d56e174181","html_url":"https://github.com/tomv564/LSP/commit/9a546564806453f830ab6394f47e33d56e174181"}]}]
